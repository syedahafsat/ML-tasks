                                                       IRIS TASK#1:
                                                    
TASK OBJECTIVE:
  Learn how to load,inspect, visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions.
DATASET USED:
  Iris Dataset(iris.csv(CSV format)) or can be loaded via seaborn.I have loaded iris dataset via seaborn.
FILE:
  iriss.ipynb(jupiter notebook),uploaded in my repository.
KEY RESULTS & FINDINGS:
  -No missing dataâ€”our dataset is clean!
  -Removed a couple of duplicates, so we have ~149 rows.
  -Setosa flowers are smaller all around.
  -Virginica has the biggest petals, easy to spot.
  -Sepal width is similar for all flowers, so it's less helpful.
  -Petal length and width go together (they're super related!).
  -These facts could help build a tool to guess flower types.
SKILLS GAINED:
  -For data loading ,inspection and data visualization use pandas.
  -Explored data and understand descriptive statistics.
  -Plotting and visualization with seaborn and matplotlib.
  
                                                  HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION TASK#2:
TASK OBJECTIVE:
    Predict house prices using property features such as size, bedrooms, and location.
DATASET USED:
    House Price Prediction Dataset(available on Kaggle): housing.csv
FILE:
    House price Prediction.ipynb(jupiter notebook),uploaded in my repository.
MODELS APPLIED:
    Used Linear Regression model.
KEY RESULTS & FINDINGS:
    -Performed preprocessing on features like square footage,number of bedrooms,and  location.
    -Trained a regression model(Linear Regression and Ridge Regression)
    -Predicted the accuracy of linear regression model and Ridge Regression model with model.score.
    -Evaluated statistical properties.
SKILLS GAINED:
    -Regression Modelling.
    -Featues(x and y) scaling.
    -Real estate data understanding.
    -Evaluated Models and predicted accuracy score of Models.

                                                    HEART DISEASE PREDICTION TASK#3:
TASK OBJECTIVE:
     Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health.
DATASET USED:
     Heart Disease UCI Dataset (available on Kaggle): HeartDiseaseTrain-Test.csv
FILE:
     HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb(jupiter notebook),uploaded in my repository.
MODELS APPLIED:
     Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,Decision-Tree Classifier,Random Forest Classifier.
KEY RESULTS & FINDINGS:
    -Clean the dataset(handle missing values)
    -Visualize box plots,histograms,violin,sunburst between the patients who have heart disease and those who have not.
    -Trained a classification model(Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,Decision Tree,Random Forest)
    -Evaluated metrics:accuracy score of different models.
SKILLS GAINED:
    -Binary Classification
    -Medical Data understanding and interpretation.
    -Model evaluated and visualization for different plots.
    -Analyzed the importance of data that is health data and built a model to do prediction for a person who is at risk of heart disease or not.
